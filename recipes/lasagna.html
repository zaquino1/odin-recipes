    <h2>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h2>    
        <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook 
            in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil 
            for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the 
            final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room 
            temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.
