    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This Italian meatball recipe is very easy to make, and since we skip the messy step of pan-frying the meatballs, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. Once the meatballs are baked, add them to your favorite prepared tomato sauce 
            and simmer for 1 to 2 hours.

    <h2>Italian Meatball Ingredients</h2>
        <ul><strong>Bread crumbs</strong>: Use store-bought bread crumbs or make your own at home. </ul>
        <ul><strong>Milk</strong>: Milk adds moisture, ensuring the meatballs don’t dry out during the cooking process. </ul>
        <ul><strong>Onion</strong>: An onion lends bold flavor. </ul>
        <ul><strong>Meat</strong>: You’ll need a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground pork. </ul>
        <ul><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the meatballs together.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Cheese</strong>: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan cheese.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Seasonings</strong>: The meatballs are seasoned with fresh parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, dried Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes. </ul>
